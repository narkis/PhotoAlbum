# PhotoAlbum
includes Jetpack, dagger, espresso
Notes:

..
This is set to run on the latest Android devices, min SDK is 26

..
There is a code based switch for a single detail view and a pager view of an album, the switch is located in CommonViewModel.kt
This switch should be refactored to the setting menu and maintained with shared prefs

..
Nice to haves:
a way to quickly advance down and up through the list with gestures.
